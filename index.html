    <h1> Who is my favorite artist </h1>
</header>

<p>  This week we're tasked with looking at who is our favorite artist. For me it was a question where the answer was simple, 
it was explaining it that was difficult. My favorite living artist is Kanye West. </p>

    <h1>Why Kanye West</h1>
</header>

<p> Kanye West emerged at a time when musicions were musicians, and rarely did they merge into the lane of "Artist"
    This was especially true for hip hop artist of the time. Hip hop was a relatively new art form (and at the time was fighting
    for legitimacy as an art form) that was dominated by overthe top but one dimensional rappers. Very rarely were these rappers
    taken seroiusly as "artist" Kanye West emerged from Chicago as a producer turned rapper who was confident and unwavvering in his 
    ability and desire to be taken seriously as an artist in all facets.

<p> When it comes to music Kanye West has released 10 offiaial solo studio albums in his career. West didn't however get his 
    start rapping. His initial forray into music was producing beats for other rappers. His discography is as followed 
<OL>
    <li>Colleg Dropout</li>
    <li> Late Registration</li>
    <li>Graduation</li>
   <li>808sandheartbreaks</li>
   <li>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</li>
   <li> Yeezus</li>
   <li> The life of Pablo</li>
   <li> YE</li>
   <li>Jesus is King</li>
   <li>Donda</li>
</OL>
For West his albums all touch on different themes both musically and personally. His first album was lauded as a refreshing hip hop classic.
It infused his trademark production style (sped up soul samples) over bragadocious but concious and self aware raps. From there he 
pushed into the follow up Late Registration. West was so serious about his work he used 2 million dollars of his own money to fund a 
live Orchestra to preform. Graduation was a triumphant album West intended to be played in Stadiums. He learned alot from traveling in 
Europe, but this album also marked a changing of the guard. West challanged and beat rap juggernaut 50 Cent in a battle for first week 
sales. 808s was an album West recorded in Hawaii (hence the 808s, but also the drum machine) after the death of his mother, and his 
engagement was called off. My beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was an album Kanye also made in Hawaii but among differnt circumstances.
West was basically exiled from music after an incident with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvaakT52RjQ"> Taylor Swift</a> at 
the VMAs. He went to Hawaii and assembled a dream team of frequent collaborators and set out to make the perfect album. West told the 
New York Times, " <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/arts/music/kanye-west-talks-about-his-career-and-album-yeezus.html">“Let me show you guys what I can do, and please accept me back. You want to have me on your shelves”</a>
This album is widely regarded as his magnum opus. Next for West was YEEZUS, his most divisive albumm. If MBDTF was a love letter to
hip hop and him asking for acceptence, YEEZUS was a messy chaotic breakup and rebelious streak saying "i don't need tou you need me"
Yeezus wa an industrial minimalist electronic sounding album. The verses were shorter and edgier, the sound shocking. Kanye 
began to dip into fashion even ranting about then YSL creative director Heidi Slimaine. West released The Life of Pablo next and 
intertwined it with his growing fashion line. His next album YE was apart of a summer flurry of albums he produced, and was also
accomapnied by an album with long time collaborator kid cudi entitled "Kids see Ghost" Kanye overwent a Christian transition,
and his music reflected it. He began doing "sunday service" performances with remakes of pop songs with Christian Themes. His next
album YE was a kanye album, but with full on Christian themes. The album went on to won the Grammy for Best contemporary Christian Album.
Kanye's most recent work is DONDA. A sprawling over one hour long album with Christian Themes that also loosely serves a tribute to his 
late mother.

    <h1>Work outside of music</h1> 
 </header>
 <p>
     Outside of music Kanye has branched into a few different areas of Art that make him an exceptional talent. Before becoming a 
     musicion, West was making a name for himself in the Art World. In high school West won a few art contest, and earned
     a scholarship to  Chicago’s American Academy of Art. West also has made a name for himself in Fashion. In the late 2000s West flirted 
     with launching a few now defunct fashion brands and also interened at Fendi. In 2009 Kanye did see the release of the Nike Air Yeezy.
     The next decade would see Kanye release the air Yeezy 2 and leave nike. When West Left Nike he took his talents to Adidas and 
     also took his newfound Fashion Brand YEEZY. YEEZY is now valeud at over a Billion dollars and has had shows in
      New York Fashion Week. He's also worked with GAP and A.P.C. and Louis Vuitton amongh other companies.

        <h1>Influence</h1>
    </header>
    <p>To look at Kanye West Influnece as an ARTIST is asking two different questions, his direct influence and his indirect influence.
        His direct influnece would be the moments he directly helped create, this could be something like creating "takeover" for Jay-z. 
        This is readily apparent and easy to notice. What's not as aparent is his indirect influence. This could be attributed to things like
        how West dressed when he first emerged. It could be extended to the fact that his emotional and personal vulnerability in music 
        spilled over into other musicians at the time. Artist from The Weeknd, to Drake, to Travis Scott, to Bon Iver and the Chain Smokers 
        site him as an influence. His use of fahion and things like Shutter Shades were ubiquitous. West fingerprints have been on
        Culture for two decades now.
